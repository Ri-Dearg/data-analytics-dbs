    "\n",
    "I built a sales calculator that uses different functions for different goals. The idea was to follow the practice of \"Separation of Concerns\". Initially, it was a group of different functions that worked together. However, once I had completed the functions, I structured it into a class so that all the related functions were contained in a single space, and variables that were used more universally, like `FILE_NAMES`, could be more easily accessed. As requested by the question, it uses files and loops to achieve its goals. More specific explanations for what the code is doing can be found in the comments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The function uses one external utility function, `validate_input_num` because it is used by other functions in the notebook as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `SalesCalculator` class initialises with some constants to be used throughout other methods. The main code is in the `run` method.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- The `run` method asks for how many items are being input, and then calls the other methods in order before displaying a final message at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `check_new_item` is used by `write_files` to confirm the product han't already been entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `write_files` runs for each item to be entered into the text files. It asks each question in order and writes the data to the files. It will always append new items to the file instead of overwriting the files on a new run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `create_dict` runs through each line of the text files and structures a dictionary from their values. This uses the specific structure of `FILE_NAMES` to create the dictionary. Finally, it returns the dictionary for calculations.  \n",
    "Changing the order of the constants or an invalid structure in the files could break the code. The question specifically requests I access the text files after they are written to continue the calculation, but I would have done things differently. I would have created teh dictionary at the same moment the user inputs the information to be written to the file. This would have avoided accessing the files twice unnecessarily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `calculate_product_stats` is run by `compile_stats` to calculate revenue, cost, and profit of each item in the dictionary and returns them. The specific structure of the dictionary is very important here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compile_stats` adds up all the values from the dictionary and displays them to the user. Uses colorama for better feedback."
